# esper
A programming language narrowly designed for code sharing across environments.

## Pitch

So, you know how pretty much each modern, garbage-collected language feels eerily like the others lately? I think it is because they are converging on the same features and concepts; they all have first-class functions, co-routines, and data classes now. The only difference between one of these languages and another _really_ is the ecosystems and platforms that they can hook into. Go gets you into the cloud and terminal ecosystems, while JS/TS gets you into the browser and to the edge. Swift and Kotlin get you onto phones, and with C# you can ship on an Xbox.

And it got me thinking: **if the languages we use to write our apps are this similar, why on earth are we writing the same logic over and over again**. Why can't we write most of our logic, constants, and types once, and important them anywhere? What if there was a language purely design to be imported in other languages?

Esper is that language.

The intent behind Esper is to incorporate the smallest set of common features from these garbage-collected languages sufficient to:
- Create common types
- Implement business logic
- Declare common constants

Of course, it wouldn't hurt to end up with a language that is pleasant to use and maintain while we're at it.

## Design

Esper is not designed to be fast, or sexy, or interesting, or well-suited for any specific domain. It should fit right into the source coce powering any ol' user interface, backend API, and smart fridge. Esper's guiding design principles, are to be:

- Simple,
- Familar, and
- Practical

Esper should never feel as esoteric and ornate as Rust, but it should feel a smidge more expressive than Go. It should be easy to read, follow, and document like Java; getting out of your way and letting you solve the damn problem like Node.js.

Described above is language that will be difficult to design, and even harder to implement. My hope in all of this, at the very least, is to move the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) in a direction that we bet the programming world would enjoy.

Wish me luck.

### Lineage

As Esper is designed to feel familiar, it borrows heavily from some popular programming languages/runtimes:

- Dependency management from [Deno](https://deno.land/)
- Module system and batteries-included standard library championed by [Go](https://go.dev/)
- Syntax largely stolen from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with a few tricks from [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) included
- Concurrency model inspired by [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- Testing is an hommage to [Dart](https://dart.dev/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/), and [Go](https://go.dev/)

#### Syntax

There is always where you want to start with a new language - what will it look like?

```rust
// Hey look ma! Pythonic imports with Deno/Go-style dependency management.
// And yes, and you have probably gathered, Esper comments = Rust comments.

from "github.com/abc/xyz@v0.9.0" import { hello, world };
from "github.com/foo/bar@v1.2.0-beta/nested/module" import * as module;

// Relative imports are a thing too. Notice how the version isn't specified - this is
// because relatively imported modules always share the version of the importer.

from "some/sub/module" import { something };
from "../bing/bang" import { boom as bÃ¼m };

// Rusty variable declaration with type inference. That means
// `some_immutable_integer` and other variables declared like this cannot be mutated.
let some_immutable_integer = 12;

// As far as primitives go, we plan to support a few:
// - `bool`
// - `char`
// - `double`
// - `int` (no unsigned ints for now)
// - `string`
//
// Operators are fairly typical too:
// - `&&`, `||`, `==`, and `!=` all do what you think they do
// - `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` all do what you think they do
//   (except that they only apply to numbers)
// - `**`, the exponentiation operator, is stolen from [ES2017](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Exponentiation)
// - `~/`, truncate divide, is stolen from [Dart](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/num/operator_truncate_divide.html)
//
// You might be wondering where all the bitwise operators are - there are none! lol.
// Good riddance.


// `mut` makes the declared variable mutable.
let mut some_mutable_integer = -7.1e2;
some_mutable_integer = some_mutable_integer + 1;

// Like in Rust, you can export stuff with `pub`. Anything not declared with a `pub`
// will only be visible to things in its own module.
pub let stuff_outside_of_this_module_can_see_me = true;

/// Doc comments! I bet this looks familar to you Rustaceans out there.
///
/// # Markdown
///
/// Who *doesn't* _love_ some sweet [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
/// formatting?
///
/// # Code links
///
/// All you have to do to reference somthing in your code is wrap it in `[]`.
/// For instance, [some_mutable_integer] is a variable we defined above.
/// (This was 100% stolen from Dart).
let a_string = "this is a string";

/// Rusty functions everybody!
///
/// No need to specify if a function is `void`, just say nothing at all:
/// ```esper
/// fn print_hello_world() {
///   print("hello world");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// There is just one wrinkle - Esper does not have positional arguments.
/// Args must be labeled unless a variable is passed along sharing the name of
/// an argument. There is one exception to this rule: if a function has just a
/// single argument, no label is necessary:
///
/// ```esper
/// fn multiply_by_two(num: double) -> double {
///   num * 2
/// }
///
/// print(multiply_by_two(3)); // prints "6"
///
/// fn multiply(a: double, b: double) -> double {
///   a * b
/// }
///
/// print(multiply(a: 2, b: 5)); // prints "10"
///
/// let b = 5;
///
/// print(multiply(a: 2, b)); // prints "10"
/// ```
///
/// Oh! And one more thing, all you have to make an argument optional is give
/// it a default value:
/// ```esper
/// fn i_cant_wait_to(action: string = "take a nap") {
///   print("Time to $action!");
/// }
///
/// print(i_cant_wait_to("eat donuts")); // prints "Time to eat donuts!"
/// print(i_cant_wait_to()); // prints "Time to take a nap!"
/// ```
fn print_labeled_measurement(value: int, unit_label: char) {
  // Printing works like it does in Dart. There is also Darty string interpolation.
  print("The measurement is $value$unit_label");
}
```

#### Module system

As mentioned above, Esper modules will work a lot like Go modules. Each directory, and all of the source files within it, act a single module.
