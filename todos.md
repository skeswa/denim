# Todos

## Sooner

- [ ] Watch the rust analyzer contribution lectures to understand that codebase
      better
  - [ ] Build a tiny clone of `rust-analyzer/crates/parser`
- [ ] Enumerate every statement and expression based on the Rust docs
- [ ] Finish implementing a basic syntax highlighter extension for VSCode

## Later

- [ ] `#[memo]` attribute for `fn`s with precisely one argument that is `self`
      to replicate `late` functionality from dart
